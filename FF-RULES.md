# Fighting Fantasies Rules

## initial stats

* SKILL Roll one die. Add 6 to the number and enter this total in the SKILL box
* STAMINA Roll two dice. Add 12 to the STAMINA box on the Adventure Sheet. 
* LUCK Roll one die. Add 6 to the number and enter this total in the LUCK box

Record also these as maximum values for each stat name


## basic fighting (without luck)

1. Roll two dice for your opponent. Add its SKILL score. This total is the opponents Attack Strength.
2. Roll two dice for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current SKILL score. This total is your Attack Strength.
3. If your Attack Strength is higher than your opponent’s is, you have wounded it. Proceed to step 4. If your opponent’s Attack Strength is higher than yours is, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If both Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other’s blows – start the next Attack Round from steps 1 above.
4. You have wounded your opponent; so subtract 2 points from its STAMINA score. Proceed to step 6.
5. Your opponent has wounded you; so subtract 2 points from your STAMINA score. Proceed to step 6.
6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either your opponents or your own STAMINA scores.
7. Begin the next Attack Round, starting again at step 1 with your current SKILL score. This sequence continues until the STAMINA score of either you or your opponent reaches zero (death). If your opponent dies, you are free to continue with your adventure.
If you die, your adventure ends and you must start all over again by creating a new character.

### escaping from battles
On some pages you will be given the option of Escaping from a battle should things be going badly for you. However, if you do run away, your opponent automatically scores one wound on you (subtract 2 STAMINA points) as you flee. Such is the price of cowardice!
You may only Escape if that option is given to you on the page.
